                        <paragraph>Southern Pudu are the smallest
                            deer on earth, measuring from 0.6 to 0.825
                            meters long. They're found in nature in
                            the temperate zone of Southern Chile
                            and in Argentina in the adjacent region. Their
                            native climate is on average warmer and wetter
                            than New York, but is still considered
                            temporate rather than tropical. Their maximum lifespan in
                            captivity is thought to be about 18, and in nature about
                            10 years. They eat
                            fallen fruit, ferns, vines and small
                            tree foliage. These animals get most of liquid from their
                            food, and are
                            only occasionally seen drinking water.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Baby Chilean Pudu have white spots on their coat.
                            Males have short (less than 10 cm) spike antlers. Pudu
                            mate in the fall
                            and give birth in the spring (bare in
                            mind in Chile the seasons are
                            opposite). Usually only one fawn
                            is born per year. It takes three
                            months for a fawn to
                            become full sized, six months for a female to
                            reach
                            sexual maturity and eighteen months for males.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Chilean Pudu, being super cute, have been captured
                            in the wild for use as
                            pets, contributing to their
                            declining population. It's speculated that the reason
                            they have evolved to be
                            so small is to be able to
                            more easily slip though the dense
                            undergrowth and
                            bamboo thinkets in their native environment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>This is a giraffe, the tallest living terrestrial animal
                            which has facinated humanity for millenia. 2016 estimates
                            indicate that there are around 100 thousand of
                            these animals in the wild, with more than 1500 in zoos.
                            Although giraffe are traditionally considered one
                            species, research in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
                            reveals that there are actually eight species. Giraffe
                            are members of of the Giraffidae family, along with their
                            closest living relative, the endangered okapi (which you
                            can also find not far from here). Giraffe are found
                            in the wild in various pockets, mostly in southern half of
                            Africa.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands.
                            Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of
                            woody plants, which they can get to easier than any
                            of the competition thanks to their long necks. They
                            are preyed upon lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and
                            African wild dogs (all of which you can see here
                            nearby except for African leopards).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Giraffes live in herds of related females and
                            their offspring, or in bachelor herds of unrelated
                            males. Giraffes are very social and sometimes
                            these herds hang out together. Males establish
                            social hierarchies through "necking", where they
                            combat using their necks as weapons. Dominant
                            males gain access to females, who do all the
                            child rearing.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph> Ostriches were almost wiped out in the 18th
                            century due to hunting for feathers. By the middle of the
                            19th century, the practice of farming ostriches began to spread.
                            This enabled ostriches to be domesticated and plucked, instead
                            of being hunted and killed. Currently, the demand for ostrich
                            feathers has lessened greatly, and ostriches seem to have a
                            secure population.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Legend has it that in Pompeii, a city in
                            ancient Rome preserved by a vulcanic eruption, there was a
                            fountain, fed by the waters of Mount Vesuvius. All those
                            who drank from it would be gifted with superhuman
                            health, wealth and looks. The fountain went dry
                            after Mount Vesuvius erupted and the citizens of Pompeii
                            lost their superhuman blessings.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In 1943, Hyman Gould visited and brought a 12 inch lead
                            pipe which proportedly once carried the waters of Mount
                            Vesuvius, back home to the Bronx as a souvineer. He reached
                            out to the Bronx Chamber of Commerce who came up with an
                            idea: They were going to build a drinking fountain on
                            Fordham road for the citizens of New York with water
                            flowing through the same pipe, probably to get people
                            to visit the Bronx.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>This is what remains of that idea and the pipe that runs
                            through the fountain. You can't drink from it today, but
                            that's okay since drinking water from old lead pipes is
                            generally frowned upon by modern health experts.

                <originalcontent>
                        <paragraph>Dippin' Dots is an ice cream snack invented by Curt
                            Jones in 1988, created by flash freezing ice cream mix
                            in liquid nitrogen. Dippin' Dots is based in Paducah,
                            Kentucky and is sold in 14 different countries. You can't
                            buy Dippin Dots in most grocery stories because it
                            requires temperature below -40 degrees Fahrenheit, -40
                            degrees celsius, to store. Although they're not cheap,
                            if you've never had Dippin' Dots before you'll really
                            only find them in places like this (theme parks, zoos,
                            and aquariums) and they filed for Chapter 11 backruptsy
                            protection in 2011, so it's hard to say if they'll be
                            around forever.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dippin Dot's was invented in Illinois, when Curt
                            Jones, who specialized in cryogenics, was trying to
                            create more efficient fodder for farm animals in his
                            parents garage. Because of the ultra cold freezers
                            the company uses for the product, sparked interest when
                            vaccines were developed for COVID-19 that required
                            storage at -94Â° F (-70Â° C). Pharmacists and distributors
                            of those vaccines reached out for those freezers.</paragraph>
