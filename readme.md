Unofficial Bronx Zoo Audio Tour - Lots of museums have cheap digital audio tours where you use an app or a gross device where you enter numbers at stations to listen to more info about what you’re looking at. In NYC the Met (https://www.metmuseum.org/visit/audio-guide) and MoMA have great ones; also in France there are bunch of great ones in the Loire Valley (Chambord has the best one I've done anywhere with interactive graphics).

The Bronx Zoo doesn’t have an Audio Tour or anything like it (closest thing is founder William Temple Hornaday’s 1899 Guide to the New York Zoological Park; read here  https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c045667025 ). I’d like my Audio Tours to include both historical information about the park (which is weirdly hard to find except in primary sources like newspaper archives and Hornaday’s book; possibly because of scandals in its history – they did lots of things that wouldn’t be okay by today’s standards although they were progressive at the time) and information about the animals taken from the Encyclopedia of Life (eol.org) and Wikipedia (their information isn’t always reliable but it’s not copyrighted and worth using as long as you double check)
